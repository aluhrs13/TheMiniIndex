# The Mini Index - https://www.TheMiniIndex.com/

The Mini Index (TMI) is a website devoted to making it easy for tabletop gamers to find 3d printable models for all their needs from various sites across the internet. Users can submit links to Thingiverse or Shapeways and add tags that are relevant to tabletop gaming.

## Disclaimer

I made TMI as a side project to solve a problem I had and to learn ASP.NET, .NET Core, and Azure development. It's by no means great code, but I'm open sourcing it in an effort to give developers who would like to contribute the ability to focus their efforts.
